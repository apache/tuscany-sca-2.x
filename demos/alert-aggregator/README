Apache Tuscany Alert Aggregator Demo
====================================

The alert aggregator demo provides an application, implemented using SCA, that 
aggregates feeds together and exposes them using the following bindings. 

binding.ws
binding.jsonrpc
binding.feed

The easiest way to get going is to build the demo

cd alert-aggregator
mvn

This will build and test the source and generate a war file 

demo-alert-aggregator.war

This war can be deployed to you web application container and tested (the war
has been tested with Tomcat 6.0.10). 

The Web Application
-------------------

Once deployed point your browser at 

http://localhost:8080/demo-alert-aggregator

Taking care to ensure the host name and port number match you local 
configuration. 

This launches a Javascript application in the browser that uses JSONRPC
to contact the server and retrived a list of alert sources and alerts that
these sources are providing.

There default sources that you see are stored in a file in the following
file

demo-alert-aggregator/WEB-INF/classes/sources.xml

This files has the following contents

<ns0:Config xmlns:ns0="http://tuscany.apache.org/sca/demos/aggregator/types">
<ns0:Source Id="0" FeedType="rss">
  <ns0:Name>BBC News</ns0:Name>
  <ns0:Address>http://news.bbc.co.uk/</ns0:Address>
  <ns0:LastChecked>10-Jun-2007 16:34:03</ns0:LastChecked>
  <ns0:FeedAddress>http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_uk_edition/world/rss.xml</ns0:FeedAddress>
</ns0:Source>
<ns0:Source Id="1" FeedType="rss">
  <ns0:Name>Engadget</ns0:Name>
  <ns0:Address>http://www.engadget.com</ns0:Address>
  <ns0:LastChecked>10-Jun-2007 16:34:03</ns0:LastChecked>
  <ns0:FeedAddress>http://www.engadget.com/rss.xml</ns0:FeedAddress>
</ns0:Source>
</ns0:Config>

You may want to adjust the "LastChecked" values to change the number of
alerts that are displayed in the first instance

Using A Feed Reader
-------------------

As this SCA application also uses the binding.feed binding you can use your
favourite feed reader to read the aggregated alerts. To do this point your
feed reader at

http://localhost:8080/demo-alert-aggregator/services/AlertsFeedServiceRSS

Again taking care to ensure that the host name and port number match you 
local configuration.

Using Web Services
------------------

The SCA application also uses binding.ws to provide a SOAP/HTTP interface. 
The demo client that uses this interface is not yet available.
