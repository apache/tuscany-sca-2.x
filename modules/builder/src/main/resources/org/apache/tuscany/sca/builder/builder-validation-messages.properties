PolicyAttachedToProperty = [POL40002] The policy {0} has been attached to a property or one of its children. This is not allowed.
PolicyDOMModelMissmatch = The DOM node which has been found as a result of evaluating the XPath attachment of policy {0} cannot be mapped back to an element in the SCA model. The structural URI of the node is {1}

MultiplePolicyLanguagesInEPR = The policy sets for endpoint reference {0} contain policies specified in more than one language {1}  
MultiplePolicyLanguagesInImpl = The policy sets for component {0} implementation contain policies specified in more than one language {1}
JaxWSClientAsyncMethodsNotAllowed = [JCA100006] JAX-WS client-side asynchronous polling and callback methods are not allowed in service interfaces
PolicySetNotFoundAtBuild = PolicySet {0} is not defined in SCA definitions
IntentNotSatisfiedAtBuild  = The intent {0} associated with policy subject {1} has no matching policy set
MutuallyExclusiveIntentsAtBuild = [POL40009,ASM60009,ASM60010,JCA70001,JCA70003] Intent {0} and {1} are mutually exclusive
IntentNotFoundAtBuild = Intent {0} is not defined in SCA definitions
NoListenerIntentSpecifiedOnService = The noListener intent may only be specified on a reference.
TransactedOneWayWithManagedTransactionLocal = The Component Reference {1} can not require transactedOneWay because the implementation for Component {0} requires managedTransaction.local
PropagatesTransactionWithNoManagedTran = The component service {1} can not require propagatesTransaction because the implementation for component {0} requires noManagedTransaction
TransactedOneWayWithTwoWayOp = The component reference {0} can not require transactedOneWay because the operation {1} is a two way operation
