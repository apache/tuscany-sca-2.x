<!-- Composite for the SpringImplicitReferenceTestCase         
 * This composite has a ClientComponent implemented with a Spring implementation where
 * Spring application context uses an implicit reference definition through a Bean with
 * a property with an unsatisfied ref attribute, which forms the reference.
 * The reference is satisified by a wire to a ReferenceComponent which is implemented
 * by a plain Java POJO.
