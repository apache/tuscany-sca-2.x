<!-- Composite for the SpringSCAPropertyTestCase         
 * This composite has the HelloWorldComponent implemented with a Spring implementation where
 * the Spring application context uses an explicit SCA property.  The value of the property
 * is set in this composite and is used to compute the response to a service invocation from
 * the ClientComponent.
