Implementation CRUD Sample
==========================
This sample demonstrates how new implementation types are constructed for 
Apache Tuscany SCA. 

The README in the samples directory (the directory above this) provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. Take a look there 
first. 

If you want to try out the crud implementation type that this sample provides
please see the implementation-crud-client sample that provides the necessary
client code to bring up an application that uses this implementation-crud

Sample Overview
---------------
This sample contains a CRUD implementation type as an example of how to create
new implementation types. Components using this implementation type always
expose the same Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete interface. This sample
uses a singleton ResourceManager to perform the CRUD operations but of course
a real component would provide a real implementation. 

implementation-crud/
  src/
    main/
      java/
        crud/                  - implementation model interfaces
        crud.backend/          - fake component implementation
        crud.impl/             - implementations of the model interfaces
        crud.module/           - gets the implementation-crud module registered
                                 with the SCA runtime
        crud.provider/         - runtime implementation
      resources/
        crud.composite         - the SCA assembly used during unit testing

  build.xml                    - the Ant build file
  pom.xml                      - the Maven build file
  
Building The Sample Extension Using Ant
-----------------------------------------
With the binary distribution the sample extension can be built using Ant as 
follows

cd implementation-crud
ant compile

See the sample implementation-crud-client to run a sample that uses this 
binding. 

Building The Sample Using Maven 
-------------------------------------------
With either the binary or source distributions the sample can be built 
using Maven as follows. 

cd implementation-crud
mvn

Maven will also test that the sample extension built properly. You should see 
the following output from the test phase.
