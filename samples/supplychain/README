SupplyChain Sample
==================

This sample demonstrates using the SCA components using the asynchronous API.

The README in the samples directory (the directory above this) provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. Take a look there 
first. 

If you just want to run it to see what happens open a command prompt, navigate
to this sample directory and do:

ant 

OR if you don't have ant, on Windows do

java -cp ..\..\lib\tuscany-sca-manifest.jar;target\sample-supplychain.jar supplychain.SupplyChainClient

and on *nix do

java -cp ../../lib/tuscany-sca-manifest.jar:target/sample-supplychain.jar supplychain.SupplyChainClient


Sample Overview
---------------

The sample provides a Customer service with a purchaseGoods operation
and a notifyShipment operation annotated with the SCA @OneWay annotation.
The SupplyChainClient exercises this interface by calling the
purchaseGoods operation. This results in messages passing to 
the Retailer, Warehouse, and Shipper components and the result returned
to the Customer service on a seperate callback thread.

Building And Running The Sample Using Ant
-----------------------------------------
With the binary distribution the sample can be built and run using Ant as 
follows

cd calculator
ant compile
ant

You should see the following output from the run target.

run:
     [java] Main thread Thread[main,5,main]
     [java] Main thread sleeping ...
     [java] Work thread Thread[pool-1-thread-1,5,main] - Order, submitted, fulfilled, shipped

Building And Running The Sample Using Maven 
-------------------------------------------
With either the binary or source distributions the sample can be built and run 
using Maven as follows. 

cd supplychain
mvn

You should see the following output from the test phase.

Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.625 sec

Results :

Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0

This shows that the Junit test cases have run successfully.
