Simple Callback Sample Using Web Services
=========================================
This sample demonstrates asynchronous messaging using a callback over the
Web Service binding.  It is very similar to the simple-callback sample.
The only differences are that simplecallback.composite has been updated
to use the Web Service binding, and there is a simplecallback.wsdl file.

The README in the samples directory (the directory above this) provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. Take a look there 
first. 

If you just want to run it to see what happens open a command prompt, navigate
to this sample directory and do:

ant run

OR if you don't have ant, on Windows do

java -cp ..\..\lib\tuscany-sca-manifest.jar;target\sample-simple-callback.jar simplecallback.SimpleCallbackClient

and on *nix do

java -cp ../../lib/tuscany-sca-manifest.jar:target/sample-simple-callback.jar simplecallback.SimpleCallbackClient


Sample Overview
---------------
The sample provides a single composite with two components. MyClientComponent is 
wired to MyServiceComponent. The interface of MyServiceComponent describes one
method as ONEWAY and with a callback semantic. When a message passes from 
client to service the response is returned via the callback asynchronously.

    main/
      java/
        simplecallback/
          MyClient.java           - client interface 
          MyClientImpl.java       - implements the client and service callback
                                    interfaces
          MyService.java          - service interface
          MyServiceCallback.java  - service callback interface, implemented by the 
                                    client
          MyServiceImpl.java      - implements the service interface
          SimpleCallbackClient.java - starts the SCA Runtime and 
                                    deploys the simplecallback.composite. 
                                    It then calls MyClientComponent which in turn
                                    calls MyServiceComponent

Building And Running The Sample Using Ant
-----------------------------------------
With the binary distribution the sample can be built and run using Ant as 
follows

cd simple-callback-ws
ant compile
ant run

You should see the following output from the run target.

run:
     [java] log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.apache.axiom.om.util.StAXUtils).
     [java] log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
     [java] Main thread Thread[main,5,main]
     [java] aClientMethod on thread Thread[main,5,main]
     [java] setMyServiceCallback on thread Thread[pool-1-thread-3,5,main]
     [java] someMethod on thread Thread[pool-1-thread-3,5,main]
     [java] receiveResult on thread Thread[Axis2 Task,5,main]
     [java] Result: -> someMethod -> receiveResult
     [java] aClientMethod return from someMethod on thread Thread[main,5,main]

Building And Running The Sample Using Maven 
-------------------------------------------
With either the binary or source distributions the sample can be built and run 
using Maven as follows. 

cd simple-callback-ws
mvn

You should see the following output from the test phase.
