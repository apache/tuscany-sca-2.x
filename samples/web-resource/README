Web Resource Component Sample
======================================
This sample demonstrates an SCA Web resource component.

The README in the samples directory (the directory above this) provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. Take a look there 
first. 

If you just want to run it to see what happens open a command prompt, navigate
to this sample directory and do:

ant run

OR if you don't have ant, on Windows do

java -cp ..\..\lib\tuscany-sca-manifest.jar;target\sample-web-resource.jar web.resource.SampleServer

and on *nix do

java -cp ../../lib/tuscany-sca-manifest.jar:target/sample-web-resource.jar web.resource.SampleServer

Now the server is started you can point your Web browser to the URL of the Web resource.

Sample Overview
---------------
The sample provides a single component exposing a Web resource.

web-resource/
  src/
    main/
      java/
        web/resource/
          SampleServer.java               - starts the SCA Runtime and 
                                            deploys the WebResource.composite
      resources/
        myContent/
          index.html                      - a Web HTML resource
        WebResource.composite             - the SCA assembly for this sample
  web-resource.png                        - a pictorial representation of the 
                                            sample .composite file
  build.xml                               - the Ant build file
  pom.xml                                 - the Maven build file        

Building And Running The Sample Using Ant
-----------------------------------------
With the binary distribution the sample can be built and run using Ant using the 
following commands

cd web-resource
ant compile
ant run

You should see the following output from the run target.

run:
    [java] Added Servlet mapping: http://localhost:8080/myWeb/*
    [java] Sample server started (press enter to shutdown)

    [java] To get the Web resource, point your Web browser to the following address:
    [java] http://localhost:8080/MyWeb/index.html
     
As this point the Web resource is exposed by a web server started automatically
by the SCA runtime. To stop the server just press enter.

Building The Sample Using Maven 
-------------------------------------------
With either the binary or source distributions the sample can be built using
Maven as follows.

cd web-resource
mvn
