Calculator Sample
=================
This sample implements a simple calculator using SCA components and run it in a OSGi environment. 

The README in the <distribution-unpack-dir>/samples directory provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. (where
distribution-unpack-dir is the directory in which you unpacked the tuscany
binary distribution archive). Take a look there first, noting that this is not a new style sample. 

If you just want to run it to see what happens open a command prompt, navigate
to this sample directory and do:

ant run

OR if you don't have ant, on Windows do

java -jar ..\..\features\tuscany-sca-equinox-manifest.jar -composite Calculator.composite -config ..\..\features\configuration\ -ttl 0 target\sample-calculator-osgi.jar

and on *nix do

java -jar ../../features/tuscany-sca-equinox-manifest.jar -composite Calculator.composite -config ../../features/configuration/ -ttl 0 target/sample-calculator-osgi.jar

Sample Overview
---------------
The sample provides a single calculator service with a default SCA (java) 
binding. The CalculatorClient exercises this interface by calling add, 
subtract, multiply and divide operations. This results in messages passing to 
the appropriate components in the composite across the local wires.

calculator/
  src/
    main/
      java/
        calculator/
          CalculatorService.java  - the first component, calls +-/* as 
                                    appropriate
          CalculatorServiceImpl.java
          AddService.java         - adds two numbers
          AddServiceImpl.java
          SubtractService.java    - subtracts one number from another
          SubtractServiceImpl.java
          MultiplyService.java    - multiplies two numbers
          MultiplyServiceImpl.java
          DivideService.java      - divides one number by another
          DivideServiceImpl.java
          CalculatorClient.java   - starts the SCA Runtime and 
                                    deploys the Calculator.composite. 
                                    It then calls the deployed Calculator

  pom.xml                         - the Maven build file        

Building And Running The Sample Using Ant
-----------------------------------------
With the binary distribution the sample can be built and run using Ant as 
follows

cd calculator
ant compile
ant run

You should see the following output from the run target.

run:
     [java] 3 + 2=5.0
     [java] 3 - 2=1.0
     [java] 3 * 2=6.0
     [java] 3 / 2=1.5

Building And Running The Sample Using Maven 
-------------------------------------------
With either the binary or source distributions the sample can be built and run 
using Maven as follows. 

cd calculator
mvn

You should see the following output from the test phase.

Running calculator.CalculatorTestCase
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.272 sec

Results :

Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0

This shows that the Junit test cases have run successfully.
