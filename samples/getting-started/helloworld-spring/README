Tuscany - Getting Started - Helloworld Spring Sample
----------------------------------------------------

This sample is an alternative version of the helloworld sample which uses the Spring Framework instead of an SCA Java component.

The changes to the helloworld sample are:
- update the pom.xml with the additional Spring dependencies
- add a Spring context xml file
- update the composite to use <implementation.spring>

As with all the getting-started samples you can run this sample with:

   mvn tuscany:run 

And then as with the original helloworld sample you may test the service by using the Shell "invoke" command:

   invoke HelloworldComponent sayHello yourName
