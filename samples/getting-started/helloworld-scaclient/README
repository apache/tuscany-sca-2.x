Tuscany - Getting Started - Helloworld SCAClient Sample
-------------------------------------------------------

This sample demonstrates using the OASIS SCAClient API to invoke a service in a remote SCA domain.

See the README in the top-level samples folder for general information on the Tuscany samples.

This project has a plain Java SE class with a main method which uses the OASIS SCAClient API to invoke a Helloworld service in a remote SCA domain.

Before running this sample you must have a helloworld service running in a SCA domain somewhere, for example, you can do that by using a separate command prompt to run the Tuscany 
"Getting Started - Helloworld Sample" with the command 

   mvn tuscany:run -DdomainURI=uri:default

(including that domainURI parameter activates the Tuscany distributed domain) 
 
You can then run this SCAClient sample with the Maven command: 

   mvn tuscany:run

As this sample uses a standard Java SE main class you can also run it with the maven exec java plugin:

   mvn exec:java

You should see the following output:

   HelloworldSCAClient, using domainURI uri:default
   Calling HelloworldComponent.sayHello("world")
   Hello world
