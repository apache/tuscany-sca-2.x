Calculator Sample
=================

This sample implements a simple calculator using SCA components. 

The README in the samples directory (the directory above this) provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. Take a look there 
first. 

Sample Overview
---------------

The sample provides a single calculator service with a default SCA (java) 
binding. The CalculatorClient exercises this interface by calling add, 
subtract, multiply and divide operations. This results in messages passing to 
the appropriate components in the composite across the local wires.

calculator/
  src/
    main/
      java/
        calculator/
          CalculatorService.java  - the first component, calls +-/* as 
                                    appropriate
          AddService.java         - adds two numbers
          SubtractService.java    - subtracts one number from another
          MultipleService.java    - multiplies two numbers
          DivideService.java      - divides one number by another
          CalculatorClient.java   - starts the SCA Runtime and 
                                    deploys the Calculator.composite. 
                                    It then calls the deployed Calculator 
                                    Components services

        Calculator.composite      - the SCA assembly for this sample
  calculator.png                  - a pictorial representation of the sample 
                                    .composite file
  build.xml                       - the Ant build file
  pom.xml                         - the Maven build file        

Building And Running The Sample Using Ant
-----------------------------------------
With the binary distribution the sample can be built and run using Ant as 
follows

cd calculator
ant 

You should see the following output from the run target.

run:
     [java] 3 + 2=5.0
     [java] 3 - 2=1.0
     [java] 3 * 2=6.0
     [java] 3 / 2=1.5

Building And Running The Sample Using Maven 
-------------------------------------------
With either the binary or source distributions the sample can be built and run 
using Maven as follows. 

cd calculator
mvn

You should see the following output from the test phase.
