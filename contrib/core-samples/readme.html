<h1>Apache Tuscany Sample Applications</h1>
<p>
    Thank you for your interest in Apache Tuscany in using the Service Component Architecture (SCA)
    for building applications. This package contains a number of samples that illustrate some of
    the core concepts in SCA and shows how to build and run them using Apache Tuscany.
</p>

<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>

<p>
    The samples assume that you have certain tools in your local environment, specifically:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>a Java5 development kit</li>
    <li><a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">Apache Maven v2.0.4</a> or later</li>
</ul>
<p>To run the web application samples you will also require a J2EE 1.4 web container such as
    <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/download-55.cgi">Apache Tomcat 5.5</a>
</p>

<h2 id="GettingStarted">Getting Started</h2>

<p>
    Many of the samples use pre-built SCA composites that implement the services they are using.
    These need to be built before any of the individual samples. To do this run:
</p>
<pre class="command">
$ mvn install
</pre>
<p>
    from this directory.
</p>
<p>
    Please see the <a href="common/readme.html">common</a> module for information on these composites.
</p>
<h3>Standalone Samples</h3>
<p>
    These sample applications are intended to be run in a standalone environment in conjunction
    with an installed version of Apache Tuscany. You can download a distribution from
    <a href="http://people.apache.org/dist/incubator/tuscany/java/sca/">http://people.apache.org/dist/incubator/tuscany/java/sca/</a>
</p>
<p>
    Please see the <a href="standalone/readme.html">standalone</a> module for specific details on running these samples.
</p>
<h3>Web Application Samples</h3>
<p>
    These sample applications are intended to be run in a standard web container such as Apache Tomcat
    or Jetty. The projects for these use a Maven plugin to package a standard WAR file that can then be deployed
    to the web container using its standard deployment tools. An Apache Tuscany distribution does not need
    to be included on your local machine as the Tuscany runtime is automatically downloaded by the
    Maven plugin.
</p>
<p>
    Please see the <a href="webapp/readme.html">webapp</a> module for specific details on running these samples.
