Building the Apache Tuscany SCA 0.90 (May 2007) Release source distribution
===========================================================================

Initial Setup
-------------

1) Install J2SE 5.0 SDK, which can be downloaded from 
   http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp. Use version of 1.5.0_06 JDK.

2) Make sure that your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the newly installed 
   JDK location, and that your PATH includes %JAVA_HOME%\bin (windows) or 
   $JAVA_HOME$/bin (unix).

3) Install Maven 2.0.5, which can be downloaded from 
   http://maven.apache.org/download.html. Make sure that your PATH includes 
   the MVN_HOME/bin directory. 


Building
--------

1) Change to the top level directory of Apache Tuscany source distribution.
2) Run

	$> mvn.

   This will compile Apache Tuscany and run all of the tests in the source
   distribution. 

   Depending on the load of remote Maven 2.0 repositories, you may have 
   to run "mvn" several times utill the required dependencies are 
   all located in your local maven repository. It usually takes some time for 
   maven to download required dependencies in the first build. Once all the 
   dependencies have been downloaded you may use the -o option to run maven
   in offline mode, for example, 'mvn clean install -o'.
